best result, this was with 
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("high")  # Better for modern GPUs

it instructs cuda to not be so precise in intermediate computations, does some approximations, rounding that would not be crucial in a 
deep learning workload..... on "medium" or "low" settings they have additional steps to ensure this precision apparently. 

and this was particularly useful after moving pipeline.to("cuda").
